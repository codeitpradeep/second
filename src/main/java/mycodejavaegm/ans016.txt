a[]={10,60,20,30,40,40,80,50};
looking like unsorted , so

Arrays.sort(a);
used to sort a[] 

create method as static 
rmvdulpele(a,len); 

We check duplicate using
for used from len-1 => 7
if(a[i] != a[i+1])
a[1] != a[2] , not equals seems not duplicate
a[j++] = a[i]; ,every time for loop checks if duplicate , j++ assign to initialize a[i] 

Inside static methods , a[] stored in heap memory , finally we return j; as 7  

finally we have 
a[0] = 10
a[2] = 20
